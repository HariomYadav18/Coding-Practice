# Coding-Practice
This repository showcases my solutions to various problems from GFG (GeeksforGeeks), highlighting multiple strategies for tackling different categories of challenges.

Since February 2025, I have been diligently following Striverâ€™s A2Z DS Algo course and GeeksfoGeeks 160 Days DSA Challenge, with the goal of solving over 400 problems within the next six months.

Documenting and sharing my progress here has helped me maintain consistency and discipline in my journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms.

My aim is to regularly provide detailed, topic-wise solutions to DSA problems, making this repository a valuable resource for anyone on a similar path. Thank you for your support!
